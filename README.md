# paper2hack
Next-gen paper.io userscript/extension. Modifies elements in the paper.io api.

## Installation

Userscripts require a userscript manager to be installed on your computer. Most are common as browser extensions. We recommend [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

### Temporary installation
If you would lke to see how this userscript works, you can just paste in the code into the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+J)

## Is this a scam?!?!

No. You can check the code for yourself, or get someone to do it for you. We do not steal your information, IP, or 'token' and send it to third parties. Again, I don't even charge money for this, and it's literally open source. If you still don't trust me, I don't care lol.

## Development

You do not need any additional tools to develop paper2hack (i.e. NodeJS, WebPack, etc...)  
paper2hack uses `lil-gui` (https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/) to create the options element at the top of your screen.
